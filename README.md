## Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity
This folder contains the codes used for the paper [Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity](Tidal%20properties%20of%20neutron%20stars%20in%20scalar-tensor%20theories%20of%20gravity/
Tidal properties of NS in ST- analytical calculation.nb).

There are two Mathematica codes:
- [Tidal properties of NS in ST- analytical calculation](Tid): it contains the analytical derivations with the xAct package and generates the equations of motion.
- Tidal properties of NS in ST- numerical calculation: it contains the numerical calculations, including the main results of our paper.
