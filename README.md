## Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity
This repository contains the codes used for the paper [Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity]([https://pages.github.com/](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2690202))
There are two Mathematica codes:
- Tidal properties of NS in ST- analytical calculation: it contains the analytical derivations with the xAct package and generates the equations of motion.
- Tidal properties of NS in ST- numerical calculation: it contains the numerical calculations, including the main results of our paper.
