# Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity
# There are two Mathematica codes, one for the analytical derivations with xAct, labeled "Tidal properties of NS in ST- analytical calculation"; and another one for the numerical calculations, including the main results of our paper, labeled "Tidal properties of NS in ST- numerical calculation".
